These modules currently preform all interactions with IBM middleware installtion process. See code for all available modules.

Current modules available allow users to focus on standardization of WebSphere installations. All modules are idempotent with a few exceptions of the backup and restore options that are available through the ibm_pmt module. Modules support ansible-doc and dry runs to check the state change if the modules were to be ran.
